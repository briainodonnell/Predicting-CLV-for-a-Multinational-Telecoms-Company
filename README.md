# Predicting-CLV-for-a-Multinational-Telecoms-Company
This is my Dissertation that I completed as part of my MSc Statistics in UCD 2019. I completed my Dissertation with Idiro Analytics and used their data to develop a probabilistic model to predict the customer lifetime value of the customers of their largest client. I proposed this research project myself and completed all research and analysis over a 9-month period. I was awarded an A grade for the project and Idiro Analytics have implemented the model to identify the highest value customers and to predict which customers are at risk of churning.
